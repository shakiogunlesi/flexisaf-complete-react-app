<b>Learning Outcome, Complete a React Application.</b>

1. Virtual DOM: A lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize UI updates by minimizing changes to the real DOM.

2. State: A built-in object that holds dynamic data in a component. It enables a component to re-render when the state changes.

3. Props: Short for "properties," props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the receiving component.

4. JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements.

5. Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX and can handle state and lifecycle events using hooks like useState and useEffect.

6. Class Components: ES6 classes that extend React.Component and can manage state and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, render, and componentDidUpdate.

7. Lifecycle Components: Special methods in class components that allow you to run code at specific stages (mounting, updating, unmounting) in a componentâ€™s life.

8. Fragment: A wrapper that groups multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, preventing unnecessary div tags.

9. Event Handlers: Functions that handle user interactions, such as clicks or form submissions, in React. They are passed as props and follow camelCase naming conventions (onClick, onChange).
